FP API idea: location resource
purpose: to optimize getting tags by location.

tag has many locations, croak has a location, location has many tags/croaks
	for finding tags in a region, only need to check if each tag has a loc within radius.
	upon each new croak, append its loc to locs of each tag if that tag does not already have a close enough loc (how to derive threshold?)

	Location:
		- id
		- lat
		- lon
		- timestamp
		- tags: []
		- croaks: []

	Croak:
		[...]
		- loc: Location

	Tag:
		[...]
		- locs: Location[]
